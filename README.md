# How Data Flows
##### This repo is from my Medium series: How Data Flows 

Hello, Welcome to my series on [how data flows](https://medium.com/@avalojc/how-data-flows-the-client-react-ef14db2d4361). This repo is part of a 3 part blog post on how data flows from the database to the server and finally to the client.

Each section corresponds with an a blog post. I hope that each section makes clear how data flows from piece to piece.
