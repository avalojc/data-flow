# How Data Flows: The Client 
###### Part 3 of 3

##### This repo is from my Medium series: How Data Flows 

The series is an intro of how data flows from the database to the server and finally to the client. Not even full CRUD. Just a deep dive into READ/Get. 

This section ([Part 3](https://medium.com/@avalojc/how-data-flows-putting-it-all-together-4d4571892952)) is intended to put it all together, so that beginners can see how data flows from piece to piece in full stack application. 

#### Part 3 
So this section, some changes are made to include a database and remove the hard coded service. In addition, the client uses the data as a source for an image tag so that you can see how data can be used in an app rather than be rendered as text. 


Checkout [Part 1](https://medium.com/@avalojc/how-data-flows-the-server-spring-boot-2ceb73009143) to see how the server serves the data.

Checkout [Part 2](https://medium.com/@avalojc/how-data-flows-the-client-react-ef14db2d4361) to see how the client interacts with the server.
