# How Data Flows: The Client 
###### Part 3 of 3

##### This repo is from my Medium series: How Data Flows 

The series is an intro of how data flows from the database to the server and finally to the client. Not even full CRUD. Just a deep dive into READ/Get. 

This section (Part 3) is intended to put it all together, so that beginners can see how data flows from piece to piece in full stack application. 

#### Part 3 
So this section, some changes are made to include a database and remove the hard coded service. In addition, the client uses the data as a source for an image tag so that you can see how data can be used in an app rather than be rendered as text. 


Checkout part 2 to see how the client interacts with the server.

And part 3 puts it all together and includes a database!
